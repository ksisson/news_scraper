# The News Forum
The News Forum is a website that scrapes articles from [the verge](http://www.theverge.com) and provides a comment section where readers can discuss the articles.

To get started, click the title of an article that interests you and read up. Once you've read and analyzed it, click the view comments button next to the authors name to see what people are saying about it. Type your comment in the textbox and add you're 2 cents to the dialogue.
